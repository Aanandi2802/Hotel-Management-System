## System Overview:


###	CURRENT SYSTEM 
 
  •	The Current File Based System of Hotel Management requires a lot of time to store a record in a file or to Manage The data. The insertion is easy but Sort the data is more difficult and That would take much more time to do that.
  
  •	Hotel Management would have lot of data like rooms’ details, room’s category, facilities provided by hotel, customer’s details, booking history, etc. Using Current Hotel Management above data can’t be retrieved easily and operations will not be easy to be done. So, we need a system which would take less efforts to do operations and Store the data will be easy and won’t require human hands.

### OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM 
 
  •	This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as record updating, maintenance, and searching.
  
  •	The searching of record has been made quite simple as all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification of that customer.
  
  •	Similarly, Record Maintenance and updating can also be accomplished by using the identification of the customer with all the details being automatically generated. These details are also being promptly automatically updates in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to-date.
  
  •	The Main objective of the entire Activity is to automate the process of day to day activities of Hotel like: 
  
    1.	Add a New Customer
    2.	Assign a Room and required facilities as per Customer’s demand
    3.	Admin can add new Room categories and Facilities whenever needed.
    4.	Computing the total Bill having charges of both Stay and Facilities too.

### ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED) SYSTEM  
 
  •	you will have all the information to better understand your guests, their preferences and what upgrades you sell the most.
  
  •	Payments are also greatly eased with an online booking platform. You can require from your guests to pay when they book, further increasing your income, and not worry about payments when they arrive.
  
  •	Online hotel management systems reduce workloads for your staff and optimize customer service. These platforms can make sure that bookings are synced and the availability is updated with each booking processing.
